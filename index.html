    <h2 class="title">Welcome to the Carolina Latinx Center</h2>
    <p class="maintext">The Carolina Latinx Center (CLC) adds to the commitment of Carolina to the Latinx community with a welcoming space and resources 
        for faculty, staff, students, and alumni. The CLC fosters and enriches the academic social and cultural experience for all. 
        The CLC is primarily focused on creating and supporting greater awareness and understanding of Latinx issues, cultures, 
        and identities through educational venues and the building of collaborative relationships across campus and the broader 
        community</p>

    <p class="maintext">The Carolina Latinx Center provides students, faculty, and staff the opportunity to explore Latinx 
        cultures, histories, and traditions and to use that understanding to work across racial and ethnic communities in 
        North Carolina, the country, and the world. For faculty, staff, and students who are engaged in research, teaching, 
        and/or service related to Latinx communities and issues, the Center connects them both with one another and with community 
        partners.</p>
    
    <p class="maintext">Our commitment is not limited to our educational initiatives, community engagement, or scholarship, but in 
        our mission and values to inspire understanding, appreciation, empowerment, and advocacy of Latinx communities. From our 
        campus-wide celebrations and recognition of the richness of Latinx communities to the one-on-one conversations with our 
        students, we advance the University’s mission of teaching, research, and public service and enhance the well-being of our 
        broader community.</p>

    <p class="maintext">Since our founding in October 2019, we have been able to imagine, build and institute several new programs. 
        As we continue to form, we are pursuing additional funding avenues to continue to meet the demand of our community. 
        El Futuro es Nuestro. The Future is Ours.</p>
